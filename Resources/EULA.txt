VMWARE GENERAL TERMS
Last updated: November 22, 2023
By downloading or using an Offering, Customer agrees to be bound by the
terms of the Agreement.
1. OFFERINGS:
1.1. Applicable Terms: The terms of the Order and these General Terms,
including applicable Exhibits and Offering-specific Notes (collectively,
the “Agreement”) govern Customer’s use of the Offerings. The following
descending order of precedence applies: (a) the Order; (b) the General
Terms; (c) the Exhibits; and (d) the Offering-specific Notes.
1.2. Users: Customer is responsible for its Users’ compliance with the
Agreement.
1.3. Restrictions: Customer may use the Offerings only for its internal
use and for the benefit of its Affiliates. Affiliates may not use the
Offerings. Customer may not resell or sublicense its rights to the
Offerings. Customer may not use the Offerings in an application service
 provider, service bureau, hosted IT service, or similar capacity for
 third parties.
1.4. Benchmarking: Customer may use the Offerings to conduct internal
performance testing and benchmarking studies. Customer may only publish
or distribute study results with VMware’s approval. Customer may submit
requests to VMware by emailing benchmark@vmware.com.
1.5. Evaluations: Evaluations are for 30 days (unless VMware specifies
otherwise in writing). Customer may not have access to data in the
Evaluation after it ends. Evaluations are provided “AS IS” without
indemnification, support, service level commitment, or warranty of any
kind, express or implied.
2. ORDERS AND PAYMENTS:
2.1. Orders: Orders are binding when VMware accepts them, which is deemed
to occur on Delivery. In the event of a payment or set off issue relating
to one Offering, that payment issue shall not impact any other obligation
to pay for any Offering provided to Customer.
2.2. Purchase Orders: To the extent permitted by law, Customer shall
issue and provide VMware a purchase order, or a series of purchase
orders, for the full term and total fees that are due contemporaneously
with the execution of each Order.  Purchase orders do not have to be
signed to be valid. Terms contained in any purchase order or other
business form do not apply.
2.3. Overages: Customer must pay all fees for use of the Offerings,
including amounts for add-on features and fees incurred based on usage.
VMware may bill Customer directly for metered or overage fees, even if
Customer originally purchased the Offerings through a VMware authorized
reseller.
2.4. Accounts Receivable: VMware may assign its payment rights, or grant
a security interest in, this Agreement and any Order to a third party
without requiring such third party to be liable for the obligations of
VMware under this Agreement or Transaction Document, provided VMware
remains directly responsible for performance of its duties hereunder
and that Customer’s obligations are not otherwise affected.
2.5. Direct Orders: This section 2.5. (Direct Orders) applies only to
Orders placed directly with VMware. If Customer purchases entitlements
to the Offerings through a VMware authorized reseller, different terms
regarding invoicing, payment, and taxes may apply.
2.5.1. Payments: Except as listed in an Order, fees for the Offerings
will be governed by the applicable price list at the time of invoicing.
Customer must pay all undisputed fees and approved expenses within 30
days from the date of invoice. If indicated on the Order, Customer may
pay the initial payment due on or before the due date (as stated in the
applicable Order) through a same day fed wire. For other payments
required by Customer, VMware will send Customer an invoice containing
updated wire transfer information at least thirty (30) days prior to
each respective due date.  VMware reserves the right to change credit
or payment terms at VMware’s discretion if Customer’s financial condition
or previous payment history so warrant.  VMware reserves the right to
impose late fees as may be permitted by law on any past due amounts.
2.5.2. Disputes: To dispute any fees in good faith, Customer must notify
VMware in writing within five (5) days after receipt of any invoice that
is materially deficient and in good faith prevents Customer from making
timely payment.  If and when appropriate, VMware shall issue a revised
invoice as soon as practically possible, which will remain payable on
the original due date or such later date as VMware may provide on the
revised invoice. Failure to timely remit payment of all amounts set
forth in an Order or under any other agreement with VMware, Broadcom
Inc., or any Broadcom entity shall, after written notice from VMware and
a reasonable opportunity to remit such payment by Customer and to the
full extent permitted by applicable law, relieve VMware of any and all
support obligations hereunder and all Customer subscription use rights
shall be suspended until payment is tendered at which time use rights
and support shall recommence.
2.5.3. Taxes: Customer agrees to pay Taxes in addition to the fees when
such payments are due. Customer (a) may only withhold tax as required by
law, subject to the application of any reduced rate allowed in an income
tax treaty or otherwise, (b) shall request all documentation required for
the reduction of withholding tax, and (c) shall provide proof of payment
of the withholding tax for credit relative to the applicable invoice(s).
3. TERM:
3.1. Term: The Agreement applies to the Offerings from the effective
date of the Order until the expiration or termination of Customer’s
entitlement to the Offerings as set forth in this Agreement.
3.2. Temporary Suspension: In the event of a security risk to a Service
or its users, VMware may suspend Customer’s use of that Service.
3.3. Termination for Cause: Either party may terminate the Agreement
(in whole or in part) or Customer’s entitlement to an Offering under the
Agreement effective immediately upon written notice if the other party:
(a) materially breaches any provision of the Agreement and fails to cure
within 30 days after receiving written notice; or (b) becomes insolvent
or subject to any form of bankruptcy proceeding.
3.4. Termination for Convenience: Excluding transactions for VMware
Carbon Black as well as transactions for VMware End User Computing
offerings, Customer may terminate this Agreement provided that Customer
also terminates each and all other agreements (direct or indirect,
whether or not related to this Agreement) under which Customer may
procure any VMware Offering or CA offering (including Symantec offerings,
but in all cases excluding any hardware offerings and associated support
contracts therefor) together with each and all Orders (however titled) in
effect, except for VMware-only those Orders entered into after November
21, 2023 need to be terminated, between the parties as of the date of
termination (collectively, for purposes of this section, the
“Agreements”), without cause and without further charge or expense at
any time, immediately upon written notice to VMware/CA sent to
usage.reporting@broadcom.com.
On or after the termination date, with the exception of any Fully
Paid-Up perpetual licenses (where the amount of “Fully Paid-Up”licenses
will equal the total whole number of licenses earned prior to the
termination and are assumed to be paid for equally over the initial
term of the associated Support Services), Customer must either: a)
delete all full or partial copies of the VMware and CA software from
all computing or storage equipment, and verify such deletion in a
statement signed by a Vice-President or a duly authorized representative
and sent to usage.reporting@broadcom.com, or b) return to VMware and CA
all full or partial copies of the VMware and CA software.
Once Customer’s verification or the VMware/CA software copies are
received, VMware and CA will pay Customer, or VMware/CA Partner,
a pro-rata refund of any License, SaaS/Cloud Service, Support Services,
or other fees Customer or VMware/CA Partner pre-paid (“Refund Fees”)
in accordance with the paragraph below. Refund Fees will be calculated
on the number of days remaining in the term (which for the purposes of
this calculation will be deemed to commence from the date Customer’s
verification or the VMware/CA software copies are received) of the
offering eligible for the refund. If the VMware/CA software is licensed
as a perpetual license and the associated Support Services is in its
initial term, Customer, or VMware/CA Partner as appropriate, will receive
a pro-rated refund of the cash consideration paid to VMware/CA based on
the initial payment schedule and shall be entitled to keep the whole
number of perpetual license Fully Paid-Up through such date, absent
language to the contrary in the applicable order.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if the Agreement is terminated
without cause, neither Party shall have further obligations under the
Agreement, except that the Parties shall remain bound by the obligations
within the survival sections of the Agreements. Refund Fees will be paid
within sixty (60) days to Customer (or VMware/CA Partner who will process
the invoicing or reimbursement of fees to Customer as appropriate and
under the commercial terms between the VMware/CA Partner and Customer),
from the date Customer’s verification or the VMware/CA software copies
are received, and any unpaid fees reflecting the VMware/CA offerings
delivered prior to the termination date shall become immediately due.
3.5. Effect of Termination: Upon termination of the Agreement or part
of it: (a) all entitlements to the applicable Offerings immediately end;
(b) Customer must stop using, and destroy any copies of, those Offerings;
and (c) each party must return or destroy any Confidential Information
of the other party in its control (other than information that must be
retained by law). Any provision that is intended by the parties to
survive termination of the Agreement will survive.
4. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
4.1. Protection: Recipient must protect Discloser’s Confidential
Information with at least the same care as it protects its own
Confidential Information but not less than reasonable care. Recipient
may not use Discloser’s Confidential Information except to exercise its
rights and perform its obligations under the Agreement. Recipient may
disclose Confidential Information only to Recipient’s Affiliates,
employees and contractors who need to know the Confidential Information
for purposes of the Agreement and who have a duty of confidentiality no
less restrictive than this section 4. (Confidential Information).
4.2. Exceptions: Recipient’s obligations under section 4.1. (Protection)
do not apply if the information: (a) is rightfully known by Recipient at
the time of disclosure without any obligation of confidentiality; (b) is
lawfully disclosed to Recipient by a third party without confidentiality
restrictions; (c) becomes  publicly available through no fault of
Recipient; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without
access to or use of Discloser’s Confidential Information.
4.3. Injunctive Relief: Nothing in the Agreement limits a party’s right
to seek equitable relief for breach of this section
4. (Confidential Information).
5. OWNERSHIP:
5.1. Customer Content: Customer retains all Intellectual Property
Rights in and to Customer Content.
5.2. VMware IP: VMware retains all Intellectual Property Rights in and to
the Offerings, including any improvements, enhancements, modifications,
and derivative works. If Customer provides any feedback about the
Offerings, VMware may use that feedback without restriction.
5.3. Reservation of Rights: Except as expressly stated in the Agreement,
the Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or
otherwise, to the other party’s content or intellectual property.
6. LIMITED WARRANTIES:
6.1. Software and Cloud Services: VMware warrants that Software and
Cloud Services will substantially conform with the Documentation:
(a) for Software, for 90 days following Delivery; or
(b) for Cloud Services, for the Subscription Term. Customer must
properly install and use the Offerings without modification and in
accordance with the Documentation. Customer must notify VMware of
an alleged breach of this warranty within the applicable warranty period.
As Customer’s sole remedy for a breach of this warranty, VMware must
either: (1) correct any reproducible error in the Software or Cloud
Service; or (2) terminate the Software or Cloud Service and refund
applicable license fees (for Software) or unused, prepaid fees
(for Cloud Services).
6.2. Professional Services and Support Services: VMware warrants that
Professional Services and Support Services will be performed in a
professional manner following industry standards. Customer must notify
VMware within 30 days of an alleged breach of this warranty.
As Customer’s sole remedy for a breach of this warranty,
VMware must either: (a) rectify the breach; or (b) terminate the
applicable Service and refund any unused, prepaid fees for that Service.
6.3. Disclaimer of Warranties: Except for the limited warranties in this
section 6. (Limited Warranties), to the maximum extent permitted by law,
VMware, for itself and on behalf of its suppliers, disclaims all
warranties and conditions whether express, implied, or statutory,
including any warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality,
fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement,
and any warranty arising from course of dealing or course of performance,
relating to the Offerings. Neither VMware nor its suppliers warrant
that the Offerings will operate uninterrupted, that Offerings will be
free from defects or errors, or that the Offerings will meet
(or are designed to meet) Customer’s requirements.
7. INDEMNIFICATION:
7.1. Defense and Indemnification: Subject to the remainder of this section
7. (Indemnification), VMware will: (a) defend Customer against any
Infringement Claim; and (b) indemnify Customer from amounts finally
awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or a
government agency, or agreed to in a settlement, for the Infringement
Claim.
7.2. Requirements: Customer must provide VMware with prompt notice of
any Infringement Claim and reasonably cooperate with VMware’s requests
for assistance. VMware will have sole control of the defense and
settlement of the Infringement Claim.
7.3. Exclusions: VMware has no obligation under this section 7.
(Indemnification) with respect to an Infringement Claim based on:
(a) combination of Indemnified Materials with non-VMware materials;
(b) use of an older version of Indemnified Materials when use of a
newer version would have avoided the infringement; (c) any modification
to Indemnified Materials other than those made by VMware; (d) any
Deliverable provided by VMware in accordance with Customer’s
specifications; (e) any claim relating to open source software or
freeware technology that is not embedded by VMware into the Offerings;
or (f) any Indemnified Material provided on a no-charge, beta,
or evaluation basis.
7.4. Remedies: If Indemnified Materials become, or in VMware’s
reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an Infringement
Claim, VMware must, at its option and expense, either: (a) procure the
necessary rights for Customer to keep using the Indemnified Materials;
or (b) modify or replace the Indemnified Materials to make them
non-infringing. If those remedies are not commercially feasible, VMware
may terminate Customer’s entitlement to the Indemnified Materials and
refund any applicable:
(1) prepaid fees for Cloud Services or Subscription Software, prorated
for the remaining portion of the then-current Subscription Term;
(2) fees paid for Perpetual Licenses or Deliverables, less straight-line
depreciation over a three-year useful life; and
(3) unused, prepaid fees for discontinued Support Services.
7.5. Sole Remedy: This section 7. (Indemnification) states Customer’s
sole remedy and VMware’s entire liability for Infringement Claims.
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:
8.1. Disclaimer: To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party
will be liable for lost profits or business opportunities, loss of use,
loss of data, loss of goodwill, business interruption, or any indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages under any theory of
liability. This limitation will apply regardless of whether a party
has been advised of the possibility of those damages and regardless
of whether any remedy fails of its essential purpose.
8.2. Cap on Monetary Liability: Each party’s aggregate liability under
this Agreement will not exceed amounts paid or payable by Customer for
the Offering giving rise to the claim in the 12 months prior to the
event giving rise to the claim, except for Perpetual Licenses, where
each party’s aggregate liability will not exceed the license fees paid
for the Software giving rise to the claim. VMware’s aggregate liability
for an Evaluation will not exceed $5,000 USD.
8.3. Exclusions: The limitations of liability in sections 8.1.
(Disclaimer) and 8.2. (Cap on Monetary Liability) will not apply to:
(a) VMware’s indemnification obligations under section
7. (Indemnification); (b) either party’s infringement of the other
party’s Intellectual Property Rights; (c) Customer’s violation of
section 2 of the Cloud Services Exhibit (Acceptable Use); or (d)
any liability that may not be limited by law.
8.4. Further Limitations: VMware’s liability for any third-party software
embedded into the Software or Cloud Services is subject to this section
8. (Limitation of Liability). VMware’s suppliers have no liability under
the Agreement, and Customer may not bring claims directly against them.
VMware has no liability with respect to any Third-Party Content.
9. DATA USE AND PRIVACY:
9.1. Personal Data: If VMware acts as a processor of Personal Data,
VMware will process Personal Data in accordance with the Data
Processing Addendum.
9.2. Account, Operations, and Usage Data: VMware collects Customer
contact and purchase information to manage Customer’s account and
to fulfill Orders. VMware also processes: (a) information necessary
to facilitate delivery and operation of the Offerings, verify compliance
with the terms of the Agreement, invoice, and provide Support Services;
and (b) configuration, performance, and usage data to improve VMware
products and services, and other analytics purposes as detailed in the
Offering-specific Notes. To the extent any of that data includes
information that identifies an individual, VMware will process that
information in accordance with VMware’s Products and Services Privacy
Notice available at www.vmware.com/help/privacy.html.
9.3. Support Requests and Professional Services: Customer is responsible
for taking steps necessary to protect any sensitive information or
Personal Data that it provides to VMware while receiving Support
Services or Professional Services. Those steps may include obfuscating
or removing such information or working with VMware at the time of
submission to limit disclosure.
9.4. Required Disclosures: VMware may disclose Customer Content or
Confidential Information if VMware is required by law or by order of a
judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction (a “Demand”).
Unless legally prohibited from doing so, VMware must provide Customer
with notice and a copy of the Demand. If the Demand relates to Cloud
Services, VMware must (i) inform the relevant authority that VMware
is a service provider acting on Customer’s behalf and all requests for
access to Customer Content should be directed in writing to the contact
Customer identifies (or if no contact is timely provided, to Customer’s
legal department) and (ii) only provide access to Customer Content if the
competent authority rejects the redirect request. If Customer requests
and at Customer’s expense, VMware must take reasonable steps to contest
the Demand. If VMware is legally prohibited from notifying Customer of
the Demand, VMware must evaluate the validity of the Demand, and, if
VMware does not believe the Demand is legal, VMware must challenge the
Demand. VMware must limit the scope of any disclosure to the minimum
information required to comply with the Demand.
10. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE: Open source software is licensed to Customer
under the open source software’s own applicable license terms, which can
be found in either the open source_licenses.txt file accompanying
the Offerings, the Documentation, or at
www.vmware.com/download/open_source.html. These license terms are
consistent with the license granted in the Agreement and may contain
additional rights benefiting Customer. The open source license terms
take precedence over the Agreement to the extent that the Agreement
imposes greater restrictions on Customer than the applicable open source
license terms. To the extent the license for any open source software
requires VMware to make the corresponding source code and/or
modifications (the “Source Files”) available to Customer, Customer may
obtain a copy of the applicable Source Files at
www.vmware.com/download/open_source.html or by sending a written request,
with name and address, to: VMware, Inc., 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto,
CA 94304, United States of America. All requests should clearly specify:
Open Source Files Request, Attention: General Counsel. This offer to
obtain a copy of the Source Files is valid for three years from the
date Customer acquires its entitlement to the Offering.
11. MISCELLANEOUS:
11.1. Transfer and Assignment: Customer may not assign the Agreement
or any Order without VMware’s consent. Once validly assigned,
the Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.
11.2. Notice: All notices must be in writing.  Notices to Customer will
be given: (a) by email to the email address associated with Customer’s

in the VMware customer portal. Legal notices to VMware will be given to
VMware, Inc., 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304,
United States of America, Attention: Legal Department.
11.3. Waiver: Waiver of a breach of the Agreement will not constitute a
waiver of any later breach.
11.4. Severability: If any part of the Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, all remaining provisions will remain in force to the
extent feasible to effectuate the intent of the parties.
11.5. Compliance with Laws: Each party must comply with all applicable
laws.
11.6. Export Control: The Offerings are subject to the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations (including “deemed export” and “deemed
re-export” regulations), and may be subject to the export control laws
of other countries. Customer represents and warrants that: (a) Customer
and any User, are not, and are not acting on behalf of: (1) any person
who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who is controlled by, the
government of any country to which the United States has prohibited
export transactions; or (2) any person or entity listed on the U.S.

and any User, will not permit the Offerings to be used for any purposes
prohibited by law, including any prohibited development, design,
manufacture, or production of missiles or nuclear, chemical, or
biological weapons; and (c) Customer, and any User, are not subject,
either directly or indirectly, to any order issued by any agency of the
United States government revoking or denying, in whole or in part,
Customer’s United States export privileges. Customer must notify VMware
promptly if Customer or any User becomes subject to any order of that type.
11.7. Governing Law: The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State
of California and U.S. federal laws, if the billing address for
Customer’s Order is in the United States, and by the laws of Ireland
if the billing address for Customer’s Order is outside the United States.
Conflict of law rules are expressly disclaimed. The United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.
11.8. Public Sector End User: If Customer is a Public Sector End User,
the Public Sector Exhibit available at www.vmware.com/agreements
supersedes or modifies the referenced provisions of the Agreement.
11.9. Third Party Rights: Other than as expressly stated, the Agreement
does not create any rights for any person who is not a party to it.
Only persons who are parties to the Agreement may enforce or rely on
any of its terms.
11.10. Force Majeure: Except for Customer’s payment obligations, neither
party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform due to any cause
beyond the party’s reasonable control, including labor disputes,
industrial disturbances, systemic utility failures, acts of nature,
pandemics, embargoes, riots, government orders, acts of terrorism, or war.
11.11. No Agency: Nothing in the Agreement is intended to constitute a
fiduciary relationship, agency, joint venture, partnership, or trust
between the parties. No party has authority to bind the other party.
11.12. Translation: Any non-English version of these General Terms is
provided only as a courtesy, and Customer's use of the Offerings is
